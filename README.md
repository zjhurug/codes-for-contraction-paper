"Enforcing contraction via data"

Authors: Zhongjie Hu, Claudio De Persis, Pietro Tesi

Abstract
We present data-based conditions for enforcing contractivity via feedback control and obtain desired asymptotic properties of the closed-loop system. We focus on unknown nonlinear control systems whose vector fields are expressible via a dictionary of functions and derive data-dependent semidefinite programs whose solution returns the controller that guarantees contractivity. 
When data are perturbed by disturbances that are linear combination of sinusoids of known frequencies (but unknown amplitude and phase) and constants, we remarkably obtain conditions for contractivity that do not depend on the magnitude of the disturbances, with imaginable positive consequences for the synthesis of the controller. Finally,  we show how to design from data an integral controller for nonlinear systems that achieves constant reference tracking and constant disturbance rejection.
